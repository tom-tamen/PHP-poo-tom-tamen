## POO SPA
The site works in a simple way with a system of classes.<br>
The code is quite clear and commented. <br>
Some important information:<br>

 - The connection to the database is done in a unique place in the file: `connection.php`
 - Passwords are hashed so for simplicity all passwords are: `123`
 - Some classes are inherited from other classes

Note: I was coding quietly when all of a sudden the php `header()` broke for no particular reason. Even going back to a working backup it didn't work anymore. So the `header()` were replaced by javascript injections.

Here is a diagram of the project classes :<br>
